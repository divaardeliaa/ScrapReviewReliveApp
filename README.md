This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the reviews of the **Relive App**, which is a sports-focused application. The analysis is based on reviews obtained via web scraping from the Google Play Store. The project aims to explore user sentiments towards the app, identify patterns, and classify reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.

## Project Overview
The **Relive App** is a popular mobile application used to record and share sports activities. In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on the user reviews of this app to understand user satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

### Goal
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the reviews dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data to make it ready for analysis.
- Use sentiment analysis techniques to classify reviews into positive, neutral, or negative categories.

## Notebooks
The project is divided into the following Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **01-relive-reviews-scrapping.ipynb**  
   Scraping the reviews of the Relive app from the Google Play Store using web scraping techniques.

2. **02-relive-reviews-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb**  
   Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the scraped reviews to understand their distribution and key statistics.

3. **03-relive_reviews_data_preprocessing.ipynb**  
   Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, outliers, and transforming text data for analysis.

4. **04-relive_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb**  
   Performing sentiment analysis on the reviews using machine learning models.

5. **05-relive_reviews_tf-idf.ipynb**  
   Implementing TF-IDF for transforming text data into numerical features for classification tasks.

## Data
This project uses the following datasets:

1. **df_reliverev.csv**  
   The raw data scraped from Google Play Store, containing user reviews, scores, and other metadata.

2. **df_reliverev_cleaned.csv**  
   A cleaned version of the data after preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and transforming text data.

3. **df_reliverev_sentiment.csv**  
   Contains the sentiment classification results for each review (positive, neutral, negative).
